I used to be a smart child. Depression kicked in too early, full blown major depression at 17. Incapable of doing anything. Dropped out of school. I couldn't read. I couldn't focus on anything. It feels like having mild amnesia. My short term memory is awful. I can't recall things I just read, conversations and so on. I feel I'm getting dumber every day. I've returned to school and I'm still struggling because I can't get myself to study or meet deadlines. It makes me so insecure being in class with 17 years olds at 21 and still fail. I'm getting slightly better, at least now I can read more than one page. I don't think my previous self will miraculously ever return. As I said, I'm doing better, but normal things such as keeping personal hygiene take a massive amount of willpower. I find that after showering, dress up, brush my teeth and put some make up on I don't have more energy. To the rest of the world, that's just the beginning of the day. I'm a shell of a person. I'm the shadow of what I used to be. My dream is/was to pursue academia. My professors and even my actual bf told me to just forget about college because of my limited cognitive abilities. I haven't been tested professionally but I took a Raven's online test and scored 90, and that has made me even more insecure. [SEP]

How do you cope with not being able to enjoy things that you feel should give you joy? Kills me knowing I’m just existing and losing time by always feeling so numb...and then there comes the comparing the reality to what things could be like anyone feel the same? [SEP]

I live with my parents and my brother, I also have a few “friends” and still, I feel completely alone. It’s been years since I have felt something for someone. I don’t know why, I can’t feel almost anything for anyone, it feels like I’m not even human.

I haven’t feel any satisfaction for anything in years. I don’t know why I don’t want to do anything. I mean everything that use to make me feel happy it’s know nothing. Empty.

I’ve been completely empty for 3 or 4 years, nothing really makes me feel anything, but at the same time I can feel like shit because of that. I cant feel nothing but anxiety. All the time I feel like I'm just wasting my life, and that makes me feel like a total and worthless failure.

For years I have not been able to feel any value in anything including myself. Nothing seems to be worth it, and continuing to carry myself every day is a greater weight.

I achieve nothing with my life, and despite how I said not to be literally alone, I feel completely alone. As much as I want, I am not able to feel any real connection with anyone like I used to when life felt normal.

When this started, I was smoking weed casually. I am currently not able to stay sober for more than a few days. This crap has only taken my interest in everything else. Smoking and changing screens in my house is the only thing I do. Going out became something that I can bear, I just want to get home as soon as possible. Going out has become exposing the empty shit that I am to the rest of the world. It's something that I can't stand anymore. I can no longer bear to continue living so empty.

I know I have a problem with drugs and my addiction to any electronic device, but I can't stop. Living stoned in any way and at all times has become the only way to carry on, to keep going nowhere. [SEP]

Google isnt trustable, depression is a joke in my country and my parents will make fun of me if i ask them, so can anyone please tell me how to know if i have depression? please. [SEP]

I feel lonely. I feel like nobody cares about me even a little. i am depressed and stressed out. I don't have anyone to talk to. [SEP]

As well hopefully this is my graduation year I’ve just been getting reminded on how behind I am with my education and how my school life was just terrible. It’s sucks that I’m in school still having 10-12 grade classes cause of me being behind in school. Cause of my struggle of coping with my health, me dreaming too far of my goals, my trauma, me wanting to just get out of school so much.

Like I can’t take this anymore. I hate high school. I want to do what I want I always express what I want to do. But, I always get shot down and reminded how behind I am. And how I’m going to fast. Like I know that and it’s making me upset. But, I don’t want to do that anymore. But, I know I have to get my diploma. So I can do what I can do. But, school at this point is just one trigger for me. It’s like I’m close to finishing but I’m now.

Sometimes I wish and wonder how would my life had been if I didn’t miss so much school due to my chronic illness, my trauma due to me being sexually abused, emotionally and mentally abused in some schools as well as in personal life. I used to be so smart and a good scholar. But, now I feel numb and stupid. I daydream too much as it’s like the only thing keeping me sane as well as thinking of creative stories of characters I draw and wishing I was in there position, just to be snapped back in to reality an see how behind I’m doing.

My friend which I care so much as she trying to help me. Sorta realized how behind I am on doing basic math and said how I needed to know this if I want to do more things in like college. It was a bit embarrassing cause she was right, I am lacking. Well already cause math isn’t my favorite subject but also cause I had a lot of issues with my math teachers a lot of them were snarky so I was really behind.

But, hopefully that made sense it’s just a rumble. [SEP]

The title says it all. My best friend of 2 years and me had a falling out yesterday which I'd rather not explain and now she has decided she hates me, never wants to see me again, is trying to turn people against me and has been sending me harassment.

It took place in Facebook messages. In our argument, both of us said things we wish we could take back (or at least I do) and misunderstandings were had. I'm not going to pretend I did no wrong, I got upset and angry and we yelled at each other. It was our only major argument in the entire time of knowing each other. We've had minor bickers, but this is the first true argument to my knowledge. Partially because I normally roll over and accept blame of things but lately I have been dealing with a lot and I guess it all got too much and I fought back.

After the fight yesterday I angrily said we both need to go away and calm down and talk when we are calm. Today I got an angry message off her blaming all of it on me and while I tried to type back my response saying there was blame on both sides and we need to talk it out, she blocked me.

I went to a mutual acquaintance to try and get my side across, they seemed understanding and wanted to mediate, which then resulted in my angry friend phoning me to have a go at me some more. I rose to it and fought back, to which she has decided that enough is enough and we are no longer friends.

I'm here feeling horrible about losing my only friend. Angry but mostly just depressed and not sure how to go on. The real thing that made me post here is that this whole situation has caused me to relapse and self harm for the first time in almost 3 years. Which is just adding a whole new level of self loathing.

Honestly, I've been feeling very low for some time and this whole situation just has me wondering why I should even bother any more. I know suicide won't fix anything, but atvthe same time it will make all the suffering end. The only friend I've had has now left me and I just can't face another day of my miserable existence without some sign of things getting better. My life is horrible, I could list so many reasons to do it which would sound less pathetic than "She doesn't want to be my friend any more." I'm in a dead end job I hate, my mom is terminally dying and when she goes I won't be able to afford my home, numerous mental health issues. But I think this is just the cherry on top that is making me seek help because without it, I don't think I'll carry on. [SEP]

Hi, so apologies in advance if this ends up being long

36m, suffer from kidney failure (on dialysis) but still working full time in an insurance company office handling claims. Have 2 kids.

More and more I feel like I can't cope. At home, I'm in a bed in my own because of the dialysis. I haven't made love to my partner in almost 3 years now. I try to show her affection and do nice things, but I think she is stressed out from looking after the kids all day, so, when I do have time off work, she goes out with her friends.

I don't get to go out, even food shopping, because she does it while I'm at work, so I spend 99% of the time in the house. I don't have any friends close by, and the people who are close by (colleagues etc) think I'm lays upbeat and super chill about things, even if I say I'm not doing so great.

I've lost interest in pretty much everything. I don't really eat (maybe some Cereal at breakfast and some bread in the evening) don't watch TV, and just feel tired and fed up. There are things I want to do, but I physically don't have energy for them.

I feel like I'm not important to anybody any more. Nobody sends a message just to see how I'm doing; heck, even my own sister and brother in law have excluded me from things recently, but involved my partner and two children.

I want to just disappear. Not kill myself, just, never have existed, so it wouldn't be a loss for anyone [SEP]

I'm currently a college student and let me say, this shit sucks. I hate every single minute of it. I always hated school with a fiery passion for many reasons. The people who said college is the best are fucking liars. College has made me absolutely despise my major. I'm not even sure if I can change it because my parents thought it would be cool to have more children than they could afford while also making college an absolute requirement. I also don't want to be in school longer than I have to. It's hell.

Whenever there's any kind of homework assignment, I will absolutely procrastinate and do it all a day before or the day of. I understand that I'd be less stressed if I did it earlier. But the problem is that I don't fucking want to do any homework in the first place and I've stopped caring. I don't even want to go to class! I don't want to write a stupid fucking essay about grand narratives. I don't want to solve overly complicated statistics problems that some shitty prof can barely teach. I don't fucking want to. I'd rather slam my tongue in a car door than do any of that shit. I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't want to. I DON'T WANT TO.

So when I do my homework, I will start sobbing. Then I have to compose myself to work on some of it. I have to take so many breaks to cry. And if I do eventually stop crying, I have the worst headache. You can imagine the quality of my work as a result. I'm so tired. I hate my life. I'd do anything, absolutely anything to cease existing. [SEP]

I have a psychiatrist who prescribes my antidepressants and I have a phone call with every month or so. I'm considering just telling the truth and saying I often feel suicidal.

What could happen? I feel as if it might be best for the situation just to be taken out of my hands and for some kind of service to be called on me because I can't make any productive steps myself and I really just want to end it.

EDIT: I'm in the UK if that makes some kind of legal difference [SEP]

This girl just 1 grade lower than me, I really want to talk to her more, and hopefully get together. The only problem is that COVID-19 rules don’t allow kids to talk to other grades, so I can only talk to her before or after school, or with some luck I can meet her in the bathroom cue line.

In the mornings I enter at 7:50 and she enters at 7:56, but OBVIOUSLY she isn’t there before 7:50, so in the morning is impossible. In the afternoon there are her parents so it’s awkward, its just so hard.
I had a few opportunities, one in the bathroom cue and that’s were we talked a little, but another one in the afternoon, she was waiting for her parents probably, I was about to talk to her more but she just turned around, and zoomed to where her mothers car was waiting.

im really sad and I need help to get this girl, pls help [SEP]

I wasn’t quite sure what to title this so I apologize. I’ve been diagnosed with MDD for about a few years now and I’ve recently got off my medication (I’m mentioning this to see if it matters or impacts the advice in any way). Anyways, I’ll have days where I feel so insanely happy (laugh at everything, dance around the kitchen type of happy) and then I’ll have a conversation with a particular person, a short interaction, and I’ll just ...drop immediately to locking myself in my room and just crying the rest of the day. Does anyone else deal with this too, what do you do to help it?
I was hesitant to mention this but I figured it might help; a lot of the interactions that hurt me are with my family so I can’t really avoid them. I’ll go out and someone will immediately start blaming me for something completely out of my control or that I didn’t do and refuse to believe otherwise. [SEP]

I am getting better with meds and I feel like I can do many things now unlike my life before meds. But I'm never really sure. I want to pursue a career I really like. I want to be a teacher, but I know depression can hit me anytime which can definitely affect my decision on taking any responsibility.

It feels like saying yes to opportunities is exciting, only to disappoint people on the last minute

(Sorry for my bad english )Im a 16 year old teenager , currently im having 6 months free from college so im mostly home.Im having bipolar depression , taking meds too .Most of the people ignore me ,I don't enjoy things anymore the way I used to .I dont have any idea neither on what should I do in these 6 spare months that I have for my happiness and self development [SEP]
My wife & I have been married for 36 plus years. Over the last dozen years or so, our love life has become nearly non existent. We still flirt, cop feels on each other but, the act never happens. She claims she has vaginal issues and, I'm inclined to believe her. But, there is still the opportunity to fool around. Or so, I believed. Someone on another social media site, suggested she was cheating on me with another or, that she was into women now. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are together all the time and, the excuses are always there. She's tired, achy, incontinent, spotting, and insists that she still finds me attractive but, still nothing. I masturbate whenever the opportunity presents but, it's not the same. I want to make love and be made love to. I want to feel her breath on my flesh, her tongue on my body and in my mouth. I also got a suggestion from a total stranger that, I branch out and, find a fuck buddy. I can't do that. I love my wife and would never hurt her that way so, internet porn it is. I am loyal to my beautiful bride & I pine for the moment when she will want to once again. Being blindly loyal really hurts. Literally and/or physically. Thanks for reading my rant. Love to you all. [SEP]

Honestly every time life starts to feel good either some crazy outside force comes and wrecks it or I ruin it. I ruined the best thing that’s happened to me in a while and honestly I’m just so disappointed in myself.

Why do I always have to self destruct when I have a good thing going. If I could shut my brain off it would be so much easier.

I hope I take this nap and never wake up. [SEP]

Yeah. I just realized this when I was asked what I’m going to do since I’m graduating. I don’t have a group of friends to go to the bar with. I don’t have a group of friends period.

Meanwhile every other person I see does. They have a circle of supporters. I just have acquaintances. I’m Lowkey happy about this pandemic because at least I won’t look like a complete loser at the graduation ceremony. [SEP]
No matter if I'm taking a walk on the street or just talking to someone, all I can think about is suffering and death. Im so drained, I have no vision in my life. I want to be free. [SEP]
Hi I really want to know how many people feel hopeless with their depression? I have a girlfriend who is clinically depressed and bi polar. Everyday is walking on eggshells because of how sensitive she is. Even with me trying my hardest to give her that zen life and self love and self improvement but her depression get in the way of all the progress we make. I’m beginning to understand that there is no curing this and the most I can do is be there for her when she gets bad. Does anyone have a story of their depression getting better or how to manage it better in order to live life because there is so much to live for we can’t let the bad thoughts take over us. [SEP]

Hi, sorry in advance if my English isn't perfect.

For context, I am a 26F, unemployed. I dropped out of my master's degree in Literature because I couldn't stand the snobs anymore, and I dropped out of my video game school last year because of a variety of reasons. Since then I've been unemployed.

I'm an artist type; I've always created things. I started drawing, then digital art, writing, music, and now I'm making video games. I absolutely love creating, and if I could, that's all I would do, aside from recording and editing playthroughs for Youtube (which I also like doing).

But it doesn't pay the bills. I live at my dad's right now so I don't pay much except for my own food. But I feel like such a loser. I have insane anxiety about finding a job so I never apply for anything, and I don't have any skills. The only types of jobs I could get are probably in retail but I hate customer service (I'm severely introverted + socially anxious). I've been in a rut for almost a year now. I want to move out and become independent, but the thought of having to go through interviews and getting a job I hate just paralyzes me.

I feel like I'm running out of options. I'm gonna end up in one of those jobs that make me miserable and I'm never gonna be fully happy. I dream of moving to Canada (I am European) and live a simple life in a small house, but I feel like I'm never gonna get there.

I don't really have any questions or anything, I just needed to vent because I can't find the courage to go to therapy. Thanks for reading. [SEP]

I’ve been on celexa for about 5 months. For the second month I started feeling the affects and felt a little lighter like I had that “push/motivation” everyone seemed to have when they go do things.

Fast forward to the end last month and this month I’ve been having a lot of days we’re I’m back on a downslope. At first it was a few times and I didn’t put much mind cause it isn’t a magic pill that’ll stop me from having bad days but it started to be constant and the way I felt before taking the medication is coming back.

{To put it into imagery, before meds I use to have these constant...moments or maybe episodes where I would feel like someone was constricting me...I felt agitated, nervous and I would feel like screaming or crying or doing something harmful to wake myself out of that state. To make the feeling ease I’d curl up in a ball and hug myself to try to relieve the pressure. }

I guess my point is am I over analyzing the situation, should I just tough through it or should I talk to the doctor to up my dose? I’m just a bit scared I’m overreacting...this is my first time on meds which I take for depression and some anxiety the doctor said I was exhibiting.

Has anyone gone through this with medication? [SEP]

Um so i’ve finally sought help today for my mental health and broke down infront of the doctor as i recounted my triggers (work related issues- complex cases and unsupportive toxic colleagues/culture). The irony is that i’m in the social service industry🤣 Anyway doc started me on Fluvoxamine, wondered if any of u guys took it before and does it help?

I’ve resigned for 1 month and i’m horrified after going through 1 interview (company said staff lunches are entitled to only 30mins, wow social service is not getting a grip, this is post covid man?) And i’m very fearful of applying to any social services for jobs as i dont think im ready to take on the fuckery of this world.

Wonder how long will Fluvoxamine kick in and When will i feel better to even look for jobs. How long did u guys take to even function at a basic level? Fucking existence...didnt ask to be born. [SEP]
