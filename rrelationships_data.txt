My wife and I have been married for 12 years. A few days ago she was walking down our stairs, tripped over our cat, and fell. Very thankfully the extent of her injury was a molar that was split in half when she hit the floor.

I told her she should visit a dentist immediately, but she didn't want to because they might pull it. I was confused, but she says she thinks it is ugly looking and makes people look like rednecks. This kind of hurt, since I'm missing two teeth due to playing hockey. She literally told me to open my mouth to look in and said "I don't want to look like that". Gee, thanks.

Anyway, since then she has been obsessed with the damn tooth. I told her she needs to go to the dentist. She doesn't have a fear of dentists, but she has a weird fear of losing this tooth. I told her we could get her a crown or a fake one if it came to it, but she refuses because there would still be a period where she wouldn't have a tooth.

This is a little surreal as she has never acted this way before nor has she been this overly concerned with her looks before. And before anyone asks, yes we are both sure she did not hit her head in the fall.

TL;DR

Wife broke tooth, complains a lot, wont go to dentist [SEP]

Alright Reddit, I need your advice.

I and this girl have been friends for almost 3 years, most of which we used to be school partners for most of the schoolwork. Recently I have decided to shot my shoot since we were both single and showed some signs that she liked me and I did too. It started as hanging out at school, then brunch twice, and then we went out on three dates for dinner:

Date #1à We were supposed to eat somewhere but happened to be fully reserved. So we ended up eating somewhere else and said that this doesn’t count and organized the second date to eat at the first restaurant

Date #2à We ended up going to that restaurant. Right before dropping her off, she mentioned that she would want to get high with me and grab something to eat the next time we hang out.

Date #3à She was not hungry that day, but we ended going to grab a snack and just sat down at the park. Later we decided to play Football in an empty parking lot (it happened that I started getting to it and she wanted to play with me. Keep in mind that was at 9 pm which felt like something out of a movie lol). She didn’t want to go home after that, so we decided to get high and just chilled together in the parking lot for a bit and we went for a walk where I had my arm around her the entire time. Finally, I go to drop her off and that’s when I leaned in for the kiss but she didn’t move, explained that she isn’t comfortable since she is high (which she looked like it lol) and said that she doesn’t want to be taken advantage of since someone did that to her in the past. I respected her decision but the idea that she thinks that I will take adv of her bothered me so I asked if she doesn’t trust me and she proceeded to say No (hurts after3 years of knowing her). She explained that she likes to take things really slow, proceeded to promise to talk about it next time, a date she was excited about because it involved her fav activity.

Fast forward to 4 days later (no contact), I hit her up saying that I got the place reserved for us, where then she proceeded to say she can't come and asked to stop seeing each other as she wants to be alone. To wish I overreacted and I said that we shouldn’t be friends anymore if that’s the case.

To me, friendship is based on trust, respect, and communication especially when she broke all three without caring. I don’t feel that I should be judged based on her previous experience. However, I understand that those experiences could affect every person differently and I can't blame her for the way she reacted 100%, but I blame her for the lack of effort she is putting

PS, she is usually a shy girl in general if that helps

tl;dr Friends for three years and went out for three dates, and then decided not see each other just because she doesn't trust me [SEP]

I recently got engaged and shared pictures of my engagement on social media. I was however surprised that a former FWB I had last year proceeded to unfollow me on social media. We met online at the start of last year. I was initially serious about pursuing a serious relationship with her but she wanted to see where things go rather than date intentionally. Over time I felt disengaged and just got comfortable seeing her as a friend which she seemed okay with. We carried on being intimate for about 6 months but no clear parameters were established about pursuing a relationship. We became really close friends.

I moved cities mid pandemic last year and the friendship with my ex fwb(26F) petered out, but we remained in touch even planning on meeting at some point post lockdown. She met someone,and entered into a relationship which she made public in January this year. I found out on social media and was very happy for her as she seemed very excited. I never bothered to ask when they met.

I too, met someone back in September who I had a connection with and share similar values and aspirations. I got engaged to her(24F) this month. I shared my engagement but never felt the need to publicise the initial stages of this relationship.

What could have prompted my ex fwb(26f) who I felt we were cool and she seemed happy and publicly in a relationship with someone to unfollow me.

I still do follow her, should I unfollow her too? Even though I don't have any sour feelings but joy for her?

TL;DR! I got engaged and shared pictures of my engagement on social media. An ex FWB who I deemed a friend proceeded to unfollow me on social media even though she is in a relationship
